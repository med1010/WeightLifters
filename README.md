We are making a program to document daily exercises and view exercise history.

An important feature is the ability to create an account so that the user can access their exercise history from any device, however for the sake of time the program will temporarily be looking at locally stored credentials for the login functionality. Once the user logins they will be on a "Home" page which shows buttons for a "New Record", "Edit Record", and "View Records" pages, as well as a Logout button

Another feature will be entering data for a day, with the user navigating to a "New Record" page and entering their reps/weights/sets/etc for the various exercises they did for that day. The default date upon opening this page will be the current day, however this can be changes so the user can enter backlogged data from previous days. The user cannot enter data for future days

Another feature will be editing data for a day, with the user navigating to an "Edit Record" page, which will function similarly to the "New Record" page except the data will be pre-populated with the existing data. This can be used to update the current day or previous days.

Another feature will be to view existing data in a "View Records" page, with the ability for the user to query for specific time periods and/or specific exercises, querying for that data in the backend, and then displaying it to the user in one of many chosen formats, such as raw data, graphs, or averages/stats

Lastly, the user will have the ability to log out and return to the Login Page
